					<p>This page is about the mini projects I have done in machine learning, both using basic machine learning models to learn
						and predict datasets. I can say that most of the work I did was writing code rather than design, but I think my code
						base and passion for the game can help me to be a great game designer.</p>

							<h2>The challenge</h2>
							<p>The goal of the Qantas homepage refresh was to modernise the aesthetic, improve the user experience and increase conversions
								on flight bookings. The tricky part was that there wasn’t scope for a back-end rebuild, so we simply had to work
								with what was already there and almost skin the front end into something new. The design didn’t need to be responsive
								as there is a separate mobile site. I’ll take you through the mobile site refresh in a separate case study.</p>
							<p>Looking at the old homepage above, it’s clear that the goal was to fit everything above the fold. I suspect that it
								may have been a business or marketing requirement at the time. Somehow, the designer of the page managed to do it,
								which is actually pretty impressive. It must have been tricky as there are quite a few elements to fit on the page.</p>
							<p class="nomargin">Because everything is above the fold, however, the page is quite busy and cluttered, making it difficult for users
								to find what they’re looking for. We used our findings from analytics and user feedback on the old Qantas homepage
								to help inform our new design.</p>

							<h2>A modular approach</h2>
							<p>Since we needed to work with existing website elements, we decided to break things up into modules, prioritise them
								and sketch out ideas for each one and how they might be laid out on the page. We also came up with ideas for some
								simple new elements to improve the page. Here are the main modules:</p>
							<ul class="ul">
								<li>Flight booking form</li>
								<li>Hero banner</li>
								<li>Promotions panel</li>
								<li>Frequent Flyer login form</li>
								<li>Flight offers (new)</li>
								<li>Destination guides (new)</li>
							</ul>
							<p>When I sketch a new interface, I often like to draw components on paper and then cut them out and stick them onto
								a larger sheet of paper with Blu-Tack. Kind of like a UI jigsaw puzzle (as seen in the above sketches). It makes
								it easier to move things around and change certain parts of the interface without needing to re-sketch the rest of
								it repeatedly.</p>
							<p>After blocking out the basic layout of the page we moved on to more detailed sketches of each module. I’ll go through
								the basic thought process behind each module design separately below.</p>

							<h2>Flight booking form</h2>
							<p>Looking at analytics, it was clear that most people who visited the Qantas homepage wanted to book a flight, so it
								was important that we made this as easy as possible. The old flight booking form (the vertically stacked form above)
								was placed in a prominent position on the page, but it looked quite complicated, which created friction for some
								users.
							</p>
							<p>Keeping all existing form fields, we visually simplified the form by highlighting the main input fields (seen in the
								new horizontal form above). We optimised the form for the most common use case – a single adult taking a return flight.
								I usually prefer to use vertically stacked forms as they’re generally more efficient to fill out, but a horizontal
								arrangement fit better on this page layout and tested quite well.</p>
